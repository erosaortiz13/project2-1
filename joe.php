            <figure><img src="images/joe_photo.jpg" alt="Joe's photo"></figure>
            <p>My name is Joe Madejski. I was born in Western NY and have lived there since. I am the youngest of his
                siblings, and therefore the best of them. A graduate of Albion Central Schools, I am currently attending
                the University of Rochester studying Cell and Tissue Engineering. </p>

            <h2>Major</h2>
            <h3>Biomedical Engineering</h3>
            <p>At the U of R, Joe is pursing a degree in Biomedical Engineering with a cluster in abnormal psychology.
                He is specializing in Cell and Tissue Engineering, which focuses more on the biological mechanisms of
                organs rather than their mechanics. The various computer courses he has taken are necessary to become
                aquainted with an omnipresent component of modern society, and to diversify his skill set. </p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <h3>Water Activities</h3>
                <figure><img src="images/pool.jpg" alt="A pool" class="fixedjoesimage"></figure>
                <p>I've always been fond of doing things on and around the water because I'm really fond of recreational
                    swimming. Sailing is a personal favorite past time of mine, where I can rely on the wind to do the
                    work while I soak up the sun. Being able to anchor the boat and fish is an added benefit.</p>
                <p>As part of my water activity interest, I have become a life guard both through the Boy Scouts of
                    America and the Red Cross, although at this point I'm sure I'd have to have both of those
                    renewed.</p>
