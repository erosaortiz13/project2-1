# Design Choices
- We chose the z-page backgroud picture because it represents what the individual profiles are studying, which is a combination of psychology and STEM fields
- The font we chose for the main headings was Roboto, because it was a geometric font that was clear and objectuve, fitting the the theme of computer science. For the paragraphs, we chose to use Open Sans because it was a good pairing with Roboto according to Google Fonts
- We chose to use a blue and purple color for the background of the profile pages because when looking up computer science and psychology on Google images a blue/purple color scheme was apparent
- For the buttons and sections of information, we gave them an orange background to contrast with the body so that users could easily identify important information 
- We tried to implements the rule of thirds on the f-page with the images of to the side of the sections while the paragraphs of information took up the rest
